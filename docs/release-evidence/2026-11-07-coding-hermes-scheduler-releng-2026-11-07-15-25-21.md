# Release readiness sweep — coding-hermes/scheduler — 2026-11-07 (tick releng-2026-11-07-15-25-21)

## Target and identity

- Repository: `coding-hermes/scheduler` — remote `https://github.com/coding-hermes/scheduler.git` (derived from `git remote -v`, not from a folder name).
- Canonical checkout: `/home/kara/coding-hermes-scheduler/coding-herms-scheduler`.
- Default branch: `main`.
- Verified remote tip: `6ae3193cc58ec3c7de4c1d98677a7d4aba5c1fe8` (`git ls-remote origin refs/heads/main` agrees).
- All gates and probes below ran in a fresh **detached worktree** at that SHA (`/home/kara/scheduler-releng-wt-20261107-1715`, 0 dirty entries), because the canonical checkout was 3 commits behind and dirty with an in-flight DRY-RUN THROTTLE worker (`internal/scheduler/dry_run_throttle.go`, uncommitted).
- Latest release artifact: annotated tag `v1.14.1` → tag object `77f64d47…`, dereferences to `de573541d21d8402fedcf8f7396702066546c96e`.

## Decision 1 — is a release due? NOT DUE

Range `v1.14.1..origin/main` = **4 commits**, and the whole range touches **3 files**:

```
.coding-hermes/board/events.jsonl
.coding-hermes/board/tasks.jsonl
docs/release-evidence/2026-11-07-v1.14.1.md
```

Census by conventional prefix: 0 feat, 0 fix, 0 perf, 0 `BREAKING CHANGE`, 0 `type!` — every commit is `pm:` / `chore(releng):` bookkeeping (3 of the 4 carry `[ci skip]`). Zero material commits ⇒ rule "zero material commits → not due". The last release shipped 36 minutes before this tick (`2026-11-07T16:39:24Z`).

## CI truth on the tip

| SHA | run | workflow | state |
|---|---|---|---|
| `6ae3193c` (tip) | — | — | **no run by construction** (`[ci skip]`, board-only diff) |
| `517eca42` | 42392863396 | CI | **FAILURE** |
| `517eca42` | 42392862306 | CI Pipeline | success |
| `de573541` (release target) | 42389771108 / 42389770383 | CI / CI Pipeline | success / success |
| `de573541` (tag-triggered) | 42392333708 | Release | success (published 9 assets) |
| `de573541` (tag-triggered) | 42392333648 | CI Pipeline | cancelled (duplicate of 42389770383, disclosed) |

The nearest board/code-bearing run to the tip is **RED**: run `42392863396`, job `build`, step `Invariant fixture battery (SCHED-GAP-147)`:

```
VIOLATION board-vocab SCHED-GAP-128: status=blocked
VIOLATION board-vocab REL-GUARD-001: status=blocked
VIOLATION board-vocab SCHED-GAP-16937: status=blocked
FAIL — 3 violation(s)
BATTERY: FAIL (board-only; checker=1 lint=0 pytest=0)
```

Reproduced locally on the current tip (`6ae3193c`), which now carries a fourth parked row (`SCHED-GAP-16934`, added by the `[ci skip]` commit `6ae3193c`, so no run ever saw it):

```
VIOLATION board-vocab SCHED-GAP-128: status=blocked
VIOLATION board-vocab REL-GUARD-001: status=blocked
VIOLATION board-vocab SCHED-GAP-16934: status=blocked
VIOLATION board-vocab SCHED-GAP-16937: status=blocked
FAIL — 4 violation(s) (board-only mode: fleet checks 1-7 not run — no local DB/TOML)
```

Consumer impact: `ops/check-fleet-invariants.py` exits 1, so `scripts/check-invariants.sh` exits 1, so the `build` job fails on **every** push to `main` until resolved. No release can be cut while this stands (exact-SHA CI red).

## The gate defect: `status=blocked` is rejected by the writer gate but supported by the reader and the canonical writer

Three shipped surfaces disagree about one spelling:

| Surface | Position |
|---|---|
| `internal/scheduler/board_vocab.go` `BoardAllowedStatuses` | `pending, in_progress, complete, duplicate` — `blocked` **illegal** |
| `ops/check-fleet-invariants.py` `BOARD_ALLOWED_STATUSES` (line 372) | same four — `blocked` **illegal** (CI gate) |
| `internal/scheduler/board_freshness.go` `RowBlocked = "blocked"` (landed 2026-09-15, ADV-R06) | `blocked` is a **first-class reader class**: "user-gated (status=blocked with a blocked_reason). Not work-to-spawn, but not idle-proof either." |
| `internal/scheduler/board_awareness.go` (d) | `blocked` rows "are USER-GATED and stay blocked until an operator unblocks; CountPending below deliberately counts only status=="pending", never blocked rows." |
| `boardctl` (canonical writer) | **accepts** the state: `boardctl create --id PROBE-1 … --status blocked` printed `created task PROBE-1`; `boardctl -C . list --status blocked` lists the 4 rows; `boardctl validate` prints `RESULT: OK`; `boardctl sweep-status --decide` reports only `guard_result`/`ci_result` prose, never `status` |
| `docs/troubleshooting-scheduling-errors.md:698` | "Off-vocabulary statuses: re-spell to `pending`/`in_progress`/`complete`" — sides with the gate |

Ordering: the reader class (ADV-R06, 2026-09-15) predates the writer gate (SCHED-GAP-164, 2026-09-18), and the gate's own comment names the parked spellings it means to catch (`todo, open, rework, new, claimed, ready`) — `blocked` is not among them. The allowlist omission reads as an oversight of that closure, not a policy decision.

Why the obvious data repair is the wrong arm: re-spelling the four rows to `pending` (the precedent used at `769b10d3`, which filed INT-CI-4182 for the identical class) makes four **owner-gated** rows count in `CountPending` and therefore dispatchable — precisely the dispatchability hazard the PM lane was closing. Widening the writer vocabulary to include `blocked` unreds the gate and preserves the documented semantics; `RELEASE-007` (`06adb23f`) is the template for exactly this kind of lockstep vocabulary widening (`in_progress`).

Left as a RELEASE-044 row for the foreman: the releng lane verifies, it does not change product gates.

## Released artifact (v1.14.1) — all five acceptance arms re-verified this tick

## Gates, dogfood, dependencies, deployed artifact

- GitReins: the only verdicts dated 2026-11-07 are bound to other SHAs (`DOC-26 a7654e57`, `DOC-27 ff1ed01a`, `DOC-29 75d37f0e`, `INT-CI-4187 e054fa46`, `QA-CHS-187 972f11c8`, `README-19 7446d2c3`); `QA-CHS-187` covers `972f11c8`, which is inside the released range. **No verdict is bound to `de573541` or `6ae3193c`** — UNVERIFIED for the release tip, hosted CI carried the gate.
- Dogfood: no entry references `de573541` or `v1.14.1` in `.qa/` or the repo. **UNVERIFIED** for the candidate (unchanged from the cut record).
- Dependencies: no dependency commits in the range; no new advisories observed this tick.
- Deployed binary: **STALE**. Live `schedulerd` (pid 3347652, uptime 11h32m) runs `/home/kara/coding-hermes-scheduler/coding-herms-scheduler/bin/schedulerd`, built `2026-11-07T05:42:56Z`, reporting `v1.14.0-40-gd0dad6d9-dirty` against released `v1.14.1`. Tracked by open rows `SCHED-GAP-162` (P1) and `SCHED-GAP-16994` (P1) — not duplicated here.
- Board: 813 rows, 91 open, 0 duplicate ids, `boardctl validate` `RESULT: OK (918 warnings, unchanged)`.

## Board writes made by this tick

- `RELEASE-043` → **complete**: five arms above verified with raw output; gate green cited as pre-tag CI Pipeline `42389770383`; tag-triggered duplicate `42392333648` recorded as cancelled, never as green.
- `RELEASE-044` → **pending, P1**: the `status=blocked` writer/reader/gate disagreement that reds exact-head CI, with the repair contract (lockstep vocabulary widening, regression fixture, docs correction) and an explicit prohibition on re-spelling the four owner-gated rows to `pending`.
